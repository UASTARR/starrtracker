Install library QTcharts

1. in starrtracker.pro add printsupport
2. In .ui promote graph widget to QCustomPlot with header file as src/graph/qcustomplot.h
3. Make sure to add the qcustomplot src and header files to the project
4. Changed ui layout
5. gpsparser to return values instead of string to become easier for other components to read data
6. Also edited it to add altitude as well.
7. Defined vectors in header file
8. Updated handleDataReady

Issue currently present:
	1. In gpsParser.cpp change result to add featherweight data.
	 	Where is featherweight data documentation.
	 	

Issue to look at:
	1. Check for overflows and data leaks
	2. If the app runs for long does it crash due to repeated plotting of data.
	3. To check if the result data in GPSParser is used anywhere else other than in handleDataReady()
	4. Is the use of double vectors correct

Possible Fix:
	1. Add time intervals in graphing components
	2. upload all data to a text file and clear all cache
	3.
